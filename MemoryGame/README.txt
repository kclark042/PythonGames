Must use python3 to run.

Selecting a Timed game will give you 90 seconds to find all of the matches.

Selecting an Untimed game will give you unlimited time to find all of the matches. 

Each match is one point.

Waiting for a few seconds at the end of a game will start it over.

The game is adapated from Al Sweigart's code found at http://inventwithpython.com/pygame
